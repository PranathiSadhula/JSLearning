Syntax: string.slice(start, end);
Syntax: string.substring(start, end);
Common Beaviour:
If start equals end: returns an empty string
If end is omitted: extracts characters to the end of the string
If either argument is greater than the string's length, the string's length will be used instead.
How Substring works in exception scenario:
If start > end, then substring will swap those 2 arguments.
If either argument is negative or is NaN, it is treated as if it were 0.
How Slice works in exception scenario:
If start > end, slice() will return the empty string. ("")
